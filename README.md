## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. A live server extension for your code editor is recommended for development.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Web_exm1
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser or with a live server.

## Usage

To view the project, simply open the [`index.html`](index.html) file in your web browser. For development, it is recommended to use a live server to automatically see changes.

If you are making changes to the styles, you will need a SASS compiler to convert the `style.scss` file into `style.css`.

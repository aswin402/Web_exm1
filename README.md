# Web Project

A modern and responsive web project built with HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript.

## üöÄ Description

This project is a demonstration of a modern web development workflow. While it was initially based on a tutorial, it has been significantly modified with custom styles, a conversion to SCSS for more advanced styling, and the integration of AI-powered features. It features a clean and well-structured codebase.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For client-side logic and interactivity.
*   **AI Integration**: Incorporates AI-powered features to enhance functionality.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari. A live server extension for your code editor is recommended for development.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://your-repository-url.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Web_exm1
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your browser or with a live server.

## Usage

To view the project, simply open the [`index.html`](index.html) file in your web browser. For development, it is recommended to use a live server to automatically see changes.

If you are making changes to the styles, you will need a SASS compiler to convert the `style.scss` file into `style.css`.
